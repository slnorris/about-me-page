## Features

- Hi There!
- I'm Shelby. I did this really funny thing where I decided to make a major career change in my mid-30s, so now here I am, juggling classes and a full time job on top of motherhood and life in general.
- My hobbies include traveling (definitely my favorite), trying new things (mainly food and coding), rewatching old horror movies that I've seen a thousand times, enjoying copious amounts of coffee, and reading.
- [This](https://www.reddit.com/?rdt=55968) is one of my favorite sites. I visit it nearly every day.
