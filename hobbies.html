        Traveling is one of the greatest loves of my life, as far as hobbies go. I've been fortunate enough to travel all around the United States, as well as five countries. One of my biggest goals in life is to take my kids on a road trip or international adventure every year. <br>

        I'm a lifelong swimmer, and thankfully Louisiana has a pretty long summer so we get to enjoy the pool quite a bit (usually until sometime in October). <br>

        Maybe I'll upload a picture of my library one day, but I LOVE reading! Especially spooky stuff; the scarier, the better. I have a massive Stephen King collection, but when I'm not scaring myself to death, I do love a good high fantasy series!
